A complete HOWTO by PTX64 ( https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/ptx64.11988819/ ) for unlocking and installing a secure, Google-less, LineageOS 19.1 on the Redmi Note 10 (mojito), including the latest Xiaomi firmware, TWRP + FBE-Disabler, Magisk + modules (for MicroG, Safenet, SSH), AuroraStore, Google Camera, AdAway and AFWall.

Eventually you'll end up with a fully Google Authenticated, fast, lightweight and hardened device, which allows you to use most app's on it. But it will also block many newly installed/rogue apps, (Google) app spying habits, bloatware, advertisements and more.
